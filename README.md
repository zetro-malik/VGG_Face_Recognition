# VGG_Face_Recognition
VGG_Face2 for facial Recognition, Training Testing code.

In training, The code is taking video or videos of different classes, extracting frames out of it
and then passing to VGGface2 feactures extraction and then making a pickle file for testing

- you can remove video frames extraction part it'll work just fine!
- If you get issue getting face detection instead of using  Haarcascade use RetinaFace, [Link to RetinaFace](https://github.com/zetro-malik/Face_Detection)
- RetinaFace works better on different poses.
